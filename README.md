# Fuzzy-Logic-Controller-for-Autonomous-Car
This project implements a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for autonomous vehicles, designed to mimic human-like decision-making in complex driving environments. The controller intelligently handles uncertainties and imprecise data to ensure smooth and adaptive driving.
